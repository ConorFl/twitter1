(DEVBOOTCAMP)
First attempt at interacting with an API (Twitter).  For a given user, the app checks if it has any
of the user's recent tweets saved in the db ('recent' is defined by how often the specific user tweets).
If it has 'recent' tweets, it displays them, otherwise it pulls the 10 most recent tweets from the API,
saves them to the db, and displays them to the user.
